- Calculates personalized recommendations

### 3. Meal Planning Contract (`meal-planning.clar`)
- Creates personalized nutrition plans based on analysis
- Manages meal plan templates and customizations
- Handles plan subscriptions and updates

### 4. Health Tracking Contract (`health-tracking.clar`)
- Monitors personalized nutrition outcomes
- Tracks health metrics and progress
- Generates health reports and insights

### 5. Research Collaboration Contract (`research-collaboration.clar`)
- Facilitates personalized nutrition research
- Manages research proposals and data sharing
- Handles researcher incentives and data privacy
